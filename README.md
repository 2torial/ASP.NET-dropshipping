# Internet Store ASP.NET Project for College Classes
Stage of the project changed from *setting up* to *adding features*. \
Next commits are going to be divided into multiple branches. \
There may be found some unused pieces of code or templates. \
\
This project's purpose is solely to represent my ability to code and to use version control system Git. \
It does not aspire to become a fully fledged site but rather to rise a question "How can this project yet to be improved?"
